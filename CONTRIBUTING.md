### Making a PR

> - Make sure you have been assigned the issue to which you are making a PR.
> - If you make PR before being assigned, It will be labelled `invalid` and closed without merging.

* Fork the repo and clone it on your machine.
* Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/raviMaurya12/DSandAlgo.git
    ```
* Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream master
    ```

    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```

    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Create a PR from our repo on Github.

### Additional Notes

* Make sure your code properly formatted.
* Issue that pull request!

- In case of any bug provide steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
  - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
